# **Flood Risk Prediction using Machine Learning**
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts flood risk levels based on environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and river level. Built using Python, trained with the Random Forest algorithm, and version-controlled with Git & GitHub.

---

## **📘 Overview**
Floods are one of the most severe natural disasters affecting millions worldwide. This project uses data-driven insights to detect early flood risk through environmental parameters. The model is trained on real-world data to predict flood occurrence accurately.

## **⚙️ Tech Stack**
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## **🔍 Key Highlights**
- Cleaned and preprocessed Kaggle dataset for model building.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships.
- Trained and evaluated a Random Forest model for flood risk prediction.
- Saved trained model as flood_model.pkl for later integration.
- Documented clear ML workflow for beginner-friendly understanding.

---

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**
- Add interactive Tkinter/Streamlit UI for live predictions.
- Integrate real-time weather APIs for continuous data updates.
- Deploy on web or mobile as a flood alert system.
